# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

In this is a follow along project, we will build an Ecommerce Application using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project key features are, REST API Creation: Through the mentor-guided project, we will learn to build scalable APIs.
Authentication: We will get to learn to implement secure login and registration functionalities. -Database Schema Design: We will get to explore how to create structured data models using MongoDB.
Backend Development: As a part of the project, we will learn to set up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.


### Milestone 1: Project Overview

The MERN stack is a popular way to build web apps. It’s great because it uses just one language—JavaScript—for everything, making it easier for developers to work on both the front-end (what users see) and the back-end (how things work behind the scenes).

MongoDB is used instead of regular SQL databases because it can store a lot of data without needing it to be in a fixed structure, which makes it more flexible.

To connect the user interface and the server, we use REST APIs. These help send and receive data smoothly.
