# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

In this is a follow along project, we will build an Ecommerce Application using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project key features are, REST API Creation: Through the mentor-guided project, we will learn to build scalable APIs.
Authentication: We will get to learn to implement secure login and registration functionalities. -Database Schema Design: We will get to explore how to create structured data models using MongoDB.
Backend Development: As a part of the project, we will learn to set up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.


### Milestone 1: Project Overview

The MERN stack is a popular way to build web apps. It’s great because it uses just one language—JavaScript—for everything, making it easier for developers to work on both the front-end (what users see) and the back-end (how things work behind the scenes).

MongoDB is used instead of regular SQL databases because it can store a lot of data without needing it to be in a fixed structure, which makes it more flexible.

To connect the user interface and the server, we use REST APIs. These help send and receive data smoothly.
=======
Mongo DB is used instead of SQL so that a large amount of data can be stored without storing them in the structured format.

We use REST API to handle the client and the server connection

### Milestone 2: Login page

1.Created login page using Tailwind CSS and React.
2.Used routers

### Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

This milestone focused on setting up the backend server for the ecommerce application. Key achievements include:

Setting up a Node.js/Express server for the backend:
Initialized a new Node.js project using npm init.
Installed essential dependencies like express, dotenv, cors, and body-parser.
Created the folder structure for the backend, including directories for routes, controllers, and models.
Added environment variables for secure configuration using .env.
Configured the server to handle API requests and send appropriate responses.
Implemented basic routes to test the server functionality, such as:
A root endpoint (/) that returns a welcome message.
A /health endpoint to verify the server's status.
Ensured the server is ready for future integrations, including database and authentication modules.


### Milestone 5: Building a SignUp Page

In this Milestone, we created the sign up page

Here the input tag takes the input of the user to take inputs of
User's first name
Last Name
Email
Password
Confirm Password
We used react-router-dom and react-hook-form to do user validation. We also used regex and also watch to see whether both passwords match or not.
In the handlePic function, we created a URL for the image the user added.
