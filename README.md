# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

In this is a follow along project, we will build an Ecommerce Application using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project key features are, REST API Creation: Through the mentor-guided project, we will learn to build scalable APIs.
Authentication: We will get to learn to implement secure login and registration functionalities. -Database Schema Design: We will get to explore how to create structured data models using MongoDB.
Backend Development: As a part of the project, we will learn to set up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.


### Milestone 1: Project Overview


The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications.The MERN stack is favored for its JavaScript-only approach, enabling developers to use a single language across the entire application

Mongo DB is used instead of SQL so that a large amount of data can be stored without storing them in the structured format.

We use REST API to handle the client and the serverÂ connection
